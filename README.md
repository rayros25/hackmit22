Reap What You Know! is an accessible, free alternative to current flashcard applications like Quizlet, which has created a paywall between the learner and online flashcard features. Compared to the minimalistic design of Quizlet, we've added a human touch: little animation of objects growing. The user could upload a .tsv file directly from Excel, with the front card content in the first column and the back content in the second. If they were able to remember the back content of the card successfully, they could click on the green "Right!" button or press the right arrow key. After a few correct guesses, the growth tracker on the left will give them positive feedback: the flower would grow, a cake will be made, a bird will hatch, etc. This provides an incentive for the user to continue to review their own content and lessen fatigue from starting at the same screen for too long.
